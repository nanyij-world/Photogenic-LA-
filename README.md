# Photogenic-LA-
This MicroPython code is part of my project "Photogenic LA". You can find the full project here: https://nanyij.cargo.site/Photogenic-LA

It is a project regarding the photography culture in LA. Los Angeles has a strong photo generating culture that both locals and visitors love to capture their glamorous moments around the city. Among the favorite spots are museums and commercial neighborhoods where contain works whose original values and intentions are not for social media posts. Hence, as respect for the original works, we want to reveal the background story and true values of places through actions of our installation in ridiculous and funny enough ways to ask for peopleâ€™s attention and introspection of their intention of taking photos.
